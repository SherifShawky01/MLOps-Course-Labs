## Project Overview

Predicting customer churn is essential for banks to retain valuable customers. This project leverages machine learning to analyze customer data and predict the likelihood of churn. The solution integrates MLflow for tracking experiments and managing models.

---

## Dataset

The **Churn Modelling Dataset** contains 10,000 rows of customer data, including:

* **Features**: Demographics, account activity, and financial attributes such as `CreditScore`, `Balance`, and `NumOfProducts`.
* **Target**: `Exited` (1 indicates churned customers, 0 indicates retained customers).

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and set up a virtual environment (recommended).
2. Install dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Optional: Set up MLflow for tracking experiments.

---

## Usage

1. Train and evaluate models using the provided script.
2. Experiment with different models and preprocessing techniques to improve performance.
3. Track metrics and artifacts using MLflow.

---

## MLflow Tracking

This project uses **MLflow** to:

* Log parameters, metrics, and models for each experiment.
* Store artifacts such as confusion matrix plots and preprocessing transformers.
* Manage model lifecycle stages (e.g., staging and production).

---

## Experiments and Results

* Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
* The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **92.5%**, with Gradient Boosting selected for staging and Random Forest chosen for production.
* Key insights: Features like `CreditScore`, `Balance`, and `Age` had the highest impact on churn prediction.
