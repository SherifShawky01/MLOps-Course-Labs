# Project Name

## Description

This project is a FastAPI-based web application that is containerized using Docker. The application is designed to run efficiently with Uvicorn as the ASGI server.

## Features

* RESTful API built with FastAPI
* Dependency management using `requirements.txt`
* Dockerized for easy deployment
* Uvicorn for high-performance application serving

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

* Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* Python 3.10 or later: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the Python dependencies locally (optional):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image and name it `your-name`:

```bash
docker build -t your-name .
```

### 4. Run the Docker Container

Run the container and name it `docker-your-name`:

```bash
docker run --name docker-your-name -p 8000:8000 your-name
```

The application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
